%This function extrapolates the wind speed measured at certain height to
%wind speed a desired height
%From Campbell and Norman (1998 )- An Introduction to environmental biophysics, p 66 ->
%Input: Measured wind speed uZ (m/s), measurement heihgt z (m), desired height h (m)

%Output: uH m/s

function uH = windExtrapolate(uz,z,h)

d = 0.65*h; %zero plane displacement (Campbell and Norman 1998)

%Solving for uStar (friction velocity)
uStar = 0.4*(uz/log((z-d)/zm));
%And solving uH for wind speed at target H height
uH = (uStar/0.4)*(log((h-d)/zm));
